# Prettify JSON

The script takes the path to a file with arbitrary data in JSON format and displays its content in the console in an easy-to-read form: adds line breaks, left indents and spaces.

# Quickstart

The script requires Python v3.5. A path of file containing JSON data is the positional argument of the script.

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python 4_json.py test.json
[
    {
        1: 2,
        3: 4
    },
    {
        5:6
    }
]

```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
